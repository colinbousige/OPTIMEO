# Summary

We present `OPTIMEO`, an Optimization Platform for Tuning, Inference, Modeling, Exploration, and Orchestration.
`OPTIMEO` is a python package doubled by a web application that helps the user optimize their experimental process by generating a design of experiment (DoE), generating new experiments using Bayesian optimization (BO), and analyzing/predicting the results of their experiments using machine learning (ML) models.
The package and the web app are designed to be user-friendly and accessible to researchers and students alike, providing a powerful tool for optimizing experimental processes in various research fields.
The Bayesian optimization part is based on the `ax-platform` package [@bakshy_ae_2018], which in turn is based on `BoTorch` [@balandat_botorch_2020].
It therefore allows for numerical and categorical variables, as well as multi-objective optimization.
To use the web application, no knowledge of python is required, the user can run it on the streamlit.io web page, [https://optimeo.streamlit.app/](https://optimeo.streamlit.app/), or run it locally on their machine for better performance.
The user can simply (1) select the desired options to generate a DoE; or (2) upload their data and perform Bayesian optimization to look for optimal parameters to minimize/maximize their experimental response; or (3) upload their data and plot it, assess possible correlations between variables, as well as run various regression models using `sklearn` [@pedregosa_scikitlearn_2011] to make predictions and analyze the importance of each feature on their experimental process.
Extensive yet accessible descriptions of the different options are provided in the web application to help the user understand what they are doing.
Using the package in python is also possible and it offers more versatility, like the possibility to make an optimization loop (in case experiments and their characterizations are done by a robot, for example) or to provide more parameters to the ML models -- the heavy lifting is done under the hood by the package (e.g. categorical variables encoding and decoding, workflows, formatting, etc.).

# Statement of need

Experimental processes are often complex and time-consuming, requiring careful planning and execution to achieve reliable results.
In many cases, researchers must conduct multiple experiments to optimize their processes, which can be both costly and time-consuming.
The traditional approach to experimental design often relies on trial and error, resulting in inefficient use of resources and time.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using advanced computational techniques to optimize experimental processes using active learning techniques such as genetic algorithms (GA) or Bayesian optimization.
While these techniques have now proven their effectiveness in various fields, they often require a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms and programming skills to be implemented effectively.
This can be a barrier for many researchers, especially those without a strong background in computer science or data analysis -- which is often the case for experimentalists.
To address these challenges, we present `OPTIMEO`, a powerful tool that streamlines the experimental process by providing a comprehensive platform for design of experiment, Bayesian optimization, and machine learning analysis.

# State of the Field

Bayesian optimization is known for its data efficiency, meaning it can find optimal solutions with fewer evaluations compared to other methods.
However, it can become computationally expensive as the number of features and evaluations increases, leading to longer computation times [@lan_time_2022].
Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, are generally faster in terms of computation time per evaluation but may require more evaluations to converge to an optimal solution [@lan_time_2022].
For example, `Sycofinder` [@moosavi_capturing_2019;@talirz_ltalirz_2019], an application with web-based User Interface (UI) was developed to optimize the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using a genetic algorithm.

However, the trade-off between data efficiency, computation time, and experimentation time is a key consideration when choosing between these two optimization methods.
The `OPTIMEO` package is aimed at helping scientists of any field to reach the optimum parameters of their process using the minimum amount of ressources and effort.
Therefore, it is based on BO for its data efficiency: when each experiment might take one or more day to run and characterize, it is much preferable to use BO to determine which parameters to use to minimize the number of experiments to run, even if it necessitates a few more minutes to run the algorithm to find new experiments.

There are several free software packages that provide similar functionalities to `OPTIMEO`, like `MADGUI` [@bajan_madgui_2025], `AutoOED` [@tian_autooed_2021] and `BOXVIA` [@ishii_boxvia_2022].
All three rely on Bayesian optimization to minimize the number of experimental evaluations and are accessible via executables or source code.
However, none of them offers the possibility to build an experimental design from scratch.
Moreover, we feel they lack the user-friendliness and accessibility that we aim to provide with our clean UI, and finally, they are not available as an autonomous python package for more advanced usage.
Such advanced usage might be required when the user wants to run the optimization loop in a high-throughput robotized lab, for example.
